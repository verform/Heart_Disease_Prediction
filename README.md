# Heart_Disease_Prediction
This is a binary classification problem 

**Steps I followed:**
* Exploratory Data Analysis
* Visualization
* Modelling
* Experimenting different models to get optimal result
* Evaluation:
   *ROC curve and AUC score
   *Confusion matrix
   *Classification report
   *Precision
   *Recall
   *F1-score
*Hyperparameter Tuning:
    *Manually
    *Randomized Search CV
    *Grid Search CV
 *Feature Importance
 
 **Problem Definition**
 Given clinical parameters about a patient, can we predict whether or not they have heart disease?
 
 **Data**
 The original data came from the Cleavland data from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/heart+Disease

There is also a version of it available on Kaggle. https://www.kaggle.com/ronitf/heart-disease-uci
